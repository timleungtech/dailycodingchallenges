# :trophy: Daily Coding Challenges

This repository is where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

## :notebook: Note

I love a good puzzle and these coding challenges are great brain teasers. These challenges are a study tool for me to solidify core concepts in programming. Viewing solutions of others in the community also helps open my mind to best practices and clever solutions. 

At the moment all the challenges here are Codewars katas. I leave comments of the problem names but not the instructions. If you would like to work on a the same kata as me, please feel free to visit my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/timleungtech/completed) and view my completed list.
